## :yellow_heart: About me
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
  As you may know, my name is Diogo Rebelo & I was born and raised in a beautiful portuguese city called Braga, where I'm also currently living and studying at the University of Minho. As a person, I think I'm quite versatile: I'm not a geek version of a computer engineer outside, but inside that version is there :smile:. On my free time, I really like to listening to music, read, paiting, be with my friends & whoever makes me happy and a better person.

## :computer: Some of my work, prettier with Stats
